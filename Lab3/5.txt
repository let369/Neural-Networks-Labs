5a)In a hopfield network each state is associated with one specific value of "energy".
 The goal for the network is to find the energy minimum in a basin of attraction for one noisy input.
So, each pair of nodes exercising a constraint to each other by the internode weight.
As a result of training the network the weight are becoming positive or negative and that maa



The main idea is that we are using using a pattern as a training
input, so this will be an energy minimum. By training the net,
we store this pattern into the weights matrix. As long as 
each state is associated with a specific amount of energy,
 after training the net, we can use a noisy pattern as input with one specific percentage
of distortion and energy in order to retrieve the stored pattern, driving the energy of the input to 
the minimum energy(stored pattern) of this specific basin of attraction. 
This happens after using the weights and the input to proceed to a synchronous or asynchronous updates of the input, transforming it to the stored pattern.
